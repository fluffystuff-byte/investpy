def random_user_agent():
    """
    This function selects a random User-Agent from the User-Agent list, which is a constant
    variable that can be found at `investpy.utils.constant.USER_AGENTS`. User-Agents are used in
    order to avoid the limitations of the requests to Investing.com. The User-Agent is
    specified on the headers of the requests and is different for every request.

    Note that Investing.com, via changing the User-Agent on the headers of every request, allows
    a lot of requests, since it has been tested with over 10k consecutive requests without getting
    any HTTP error code from Investing.com.

    Returns:
        :obj:`str` - user_agent:
            The returned :obj:`str` is the name of a random User-Agent, which will be passed on the
            headers of a request so to avoid restrictions due to the use of multiple requests from the
            same User-Agent.
